# What is this?

This is my attempt at making a small euh... game.
I am not entirely sure what this game is going to look like. We will see.
:P

# How to play the game?

Simple: just download the game and open the file
**index.html** contained therein.

## Download:

You can click on the green button **Clone or Download** at the upper
right corner to download this repository, or you can run
`git clone http://github.com/JSDurand/gameIV.git`
on the command line.

# How to play the game without downloading?

Well, this will happen, some time after this game is mature enough.
:D
